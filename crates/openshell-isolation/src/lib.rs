//! The `OpenShell` **Isolation Backend** runtime contract (RFC 0012).
//!
//! An isolation backend establishes and enforces an agent's isolation boundary;
//! the supervisor drives it as the policy authority. The supervisor-facing
//! contract lives in [`contract`]: an object-safe, runtime-selectable factory
//! plus a fixed chain of boxed lifecycle states the supervisor advances without
//! branching on where the boundary sits. The same calls work whether the
//! boundary lives in the agent's container (the in-pod backend) or further out
//! (a microVM, a node daemon, a separate pod).
//!
//! # The isolation envelope
//!
//! The boundary spans four [dimensions](IsolationDimension): network, filesystem
//! (Landlock), syscall (seccomp), and identity (procfs). A valid backend
//! establishes all four before the agent runs; some (network, identity) are also
//! operated at runtime through the interfaces the lifecycle exposes
//! ([`contract::IdentitySource`], [`contract::BoundaryExec`],
//! [`contract::BoundaryPortForward`], [`contract::EventSource`]).
//!
//! # Ordering is a security property
//!
//! The lifecycle states run in order: attach -> claim -> bind -> confirm ->
//! start. Nothing runs inside the boundary until it is confirmed ready. This is
//! enforced *by construction*: each transition consumes the prior state by
//! value, and no state type has a public constructor, so the supervisor cannot
//! skip a stage or run a workload before [`contract::ReadyBoundary`] exists.
//!
//! [`AgentSpec`] is shared between the workload definition the supervisor
//! submits and the [`contract::ClaimContext`] that binds it to a boundary.

/// The four dimensions of the isolation envelope (RFC 0012).

/// A valid backend establishes all four before the agent runs. The variants are
/// a machine-readable inventory for an admission layer; the runtime contract in
